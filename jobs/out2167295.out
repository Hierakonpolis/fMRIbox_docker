Step 1  of 9: reading in images...Done! It took roughly 1 seconds
Step 2 of 9: registration...
  2a) Similarity transform...
  2b) Affine transform...
  2c) Resampling volume...
  Registration done! It took roughly 12 seconds
Step 3 of 9: rough bias field correction...Done! It took roughly 7 seconds
Step 4 of 9: calculating features...Done! It took roughly 20 seconds
Step 5 of 9: voxel classification...Done! It took roughly 12 seconds
Step 6 of 9: fitting the shape model...Done! It took roughly 5 seconds
Step 7 of 9: free deformation...Done! It took roughly 0 seconds
Step 8 of 9: building volume from mesh...Done! It took roughly 2 seconds
Step 9 of 9: warping back to original space...Done! It took roughly 1 seconds

waiting for moco
function moco_sc was called
inside moco function 1 - don't need to pull slice timing from json file, use dataseries.txt
inside moco fucntion 2 - no need to find place where 0 occurs out of order, FBIRN fine
inside moco fucntion 3 - FBIRN I already know the slice timing should be TR=2
inside moco fucntion 4 - removed outliers with despike sucessfully
inside moco fucntion 5 - no need to timshift
inside moco fucntion 6 - motion corrected using 3dvolreg successful
inside moco function 7 - data reorientation using 3dresample successful
finish moco_sc
now using c3d_affine_tool
